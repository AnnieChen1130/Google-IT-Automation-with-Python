# Finish a Puppet deployment

### Introduction
You want to automatically manage the computers in your company's fleet, including a number of different machines with different operating systems. You've decided to use Puppet to automate the configurations on these machines. Part of the setup is already done, but there are more rules that need to be added, and more operating systems to consider.

Prerequisite

Understands the basics of Puppet, including:

* How to create Puppet classes and rules
* How Puppet interacts with different OSs
* How to use the DSL to create complex rules

## Install packages
There's a module named packages on the Puppet VM instance that takes care of installing the packages that are needed on the machines in the fleet. Use the command to visit the module:

cd /etc/puppet/code/environments/production/modules/packages
Now, add an additional resource in the same init.pp file within the path /etc/puppet/code/environments/production/modules/packages, ensuring the golang package gets installed on all machines that belong to the Debian family of operating systems (which includes Debian, Ubuntu, LinuxMint, and a bunch of others).

This resource will be very similar to the previous python-requests one. Add edit permission to the file before moving forward using:

sudo chmod 646 manifests/init.pp
Copied!
To install the package on Debian systems only, you'll need to use the os family fact, like this:

if $facts[os][family] == "Debian" {
Resource entry to install golang package
}
Copied!
Now, open the file using nano editor and add the resource entry specifying golang package to be installed on all machines of Debian family after the previous resource entry.

The snippet would now look like this:

if $facts[os][family] == "Debian" {
     package { 'golang':
       ensure => installed,
     }
  }

## Fetch machine information
It's now time to navigate to the machine_info module in our Puppet environment. In the Puppet VM terminal, navigate to the module using the following command:

cd /etc/puppet/code/environments/production/modules/machine_info
Copied!
The machine_info module gathers some information from the machine using Puppet facts and then stores it in a file. Currently, the module is always storing this information in /tmp/machine_info.

Now we will be using $facts[kernel] fact to check if the kernel is "windows". If so, set a $info_path variable to "C:\Windows\Temp\Machine_Info.txt", otherwise set it to "/tmp/machine_info.txt". To do this, open the file using nano editor and add the below rule after the default path within the class machine_info.

  if $facts[kernel] == "windows" {
       $info_path = "C:\Windows\Temp\Machine_Info.txt"
  } else {
       $info_path = "/tmp/machine_info.txt"
  }

By default the file resources are stored in the path defined in the name of the resource (the string in the first line) within the class. We can also set different paths, by setting the path attribute.

We will now be renaming the resource to "machine_info" and then use the variable in the path attribute. The variable we are using to store the path in the above rule is $info_path.

The complete manifests/init.pp file should now look like this:

class machine_info {
  if $facts[kernel] == "windows" {
       $info_path = "C:\Windows\Temp\Machine_Info.txt"
   } else {
       $info_path = "/tmp/machine_info.txt"
   }
 file { 'machine_info':
       path => $info_path,
       content => template('machine_info/info.erb'),
   }
}

### Puppet Templates
Templates are documents that combine code, data, and literal text to produce a final rendered output. The goal of a template is to manage a complicated piece of text with simple inputs.

In Puppet, you'll usually use templates to manage the content of configuration files (via the content attribute of the file resource type).

Templates are written in a templating language, which is specialized for generating text from data. Puppet supports two templating languages:

Embedded Puppet (EPP) uses Puppet expressions in special tags. It's easy for any Puppet user to read, but only works with newer Puppet versions. (â‰¥ 4.0, or late 3.x versions with future parser enabled.)
Embedded Ruby (ERB) uses Ruby code in tags. You need to know a small bit of Ruby to read it, but it works with all Puppet versions.
Now, take a look at the template file using the following command.

cat templates/info.erb
Copied!
Puppet templates generally use data taken from Puppet variables. Templates are files that are pre-processed, some values gets replaced with variables. In this case, the file currently includes the values of three facts. We will be adding a new fact in this file now.

Add edit permissions to the file using templates/info.erb using the following command:

sudo chmod 646 templates/info.erb
Copied!
Now open the file using nano editor and add the following fact just after the last fact within the file:

Network Interfaces: <%= @interfaces %>
Copied!
The template should now look like this:

Machine Information
-------------------
Disks: <%= @disks %>
Memory: <%= @memory %>
Processors: <%= @processors %>
Network Interfaces: <%= @interfaces %>
}
Copied!
To check if this worked correctly, return to linux-instance VM terminal and manually run the client on that machine using the following command:

sudo puppet agent -v --test
Copied!
This command should run successfully and the catalog should be applied.

Now verify that the machine_info file has the required information using:

cat /tmp/machine_info.txt

And with that, you've seen how you can fetch machine information and store it according to the operating system.

## Reboot machine
For the last exercise, we will be creating a new module named reboot, that checks if a node has been online for more than 30 days. If so, then reboot the computer.

To do that, you'll start by creating the module directory.

Switch back to puppet VM terminal and run the following command:

sudo mkdir -p /etc/puppet/code/environments/production/modules/reboot/manifests
Copied!
Go to the manifests/ directory.

cd /etc/puppet/code/environments/production/modules/reboot/manifests
Copied!
Create an init.pp file for the reboot module in the manifests/ directory.

sudo touch init.pp
Copied!
Open init.pp with nano editor using sudo.

sudo nano init.pp
Copied!
In this file, you'll start by creating a class called reboot.

The way to reboot a computer depends on the OS that it's running. So, you'll set a variable that has one of the following reboot commands, based on the kernel fact:

shutdown /r on windows
shutdown -r now on Darwin (macOS)
reboot on Linux.
Hence, add the following snippet in the file init.pp:

class reboot {
  if $facts[kernel] == "windows" {
    $cmd = "shutdown /r"
  } elsif $facts[kernel] == "Darwin" {
    $cmd = "shutdown -r now"
  } else {
    $cmd = "reboot"
  }
}
Copied!
With this variable defined, we will now define an exec resource that calls the command, but only when the uptime_days fact is larger than 30 days.

Add the following snippet after the previous one within the class definition in the file reboot/manifests/init.pp:

if $facts[uptime_days] > 30 {
        exec { 'reboot':
           command => $cmd,
        }
    }
Copied!
The complete reboot/manifests/init.pp should now look like this:

class reboot {
  if $facts[kernel] == "windows" {
    $cmd = "shutdown /r"
  } elsif $facts[kernel] == "Darwin" {
    $cmd = "shutdown -r now"
  } else {
    $cmd = "reboot"
  }
  if $facts[uptime_days] > 30 {
    exec { 'reboot':
      command => $cmd,
     }
   }
}
Copied!
Finally, to get this module executed, make sure to include it in the site.pp file.

So, edit /etc/puppet/code/environments/production/manifests/site.pp using the following command:

sudo nano /etc/puppet/code/environments/production/manifests/site.pp 
Copied!
Add an extra line that includes the reboot module.

The file /etc/puppet/code/environments/production/manifests/site.pp should now look like this:

node default {
   class { 'packages': }
   class { 'machine_info': }
   class { 'reboot': }
}
Copied!
Run the client on linux-instance VM terminal:

sudo puppet agent -v --test
