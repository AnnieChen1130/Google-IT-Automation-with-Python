The Human Resources Department at your company wants you to find out how many people are in each department. You need to write a Python script that reads a CSV file containing a list of the employees in the organization, counts how many people are in each department, and then generates a report using this information. The output of this script will be a plain text file. We will guide you through each step of the lab.",

      "source": "Open the CSV file by calling open and then csv.DictReader.\n\nDictReader creates an object that operates like a regular reader (an object that iterates over lines in the given CSV file), but also maps the information it reads into a dictionary where keys are given by the optional fieldnames parameter. If we omit the fieldnames parameter, the values in the first row of the CSV file will be used as the keys. So, in this case, the first line of the CSV file has the keys and so there's no need to pass fieldnames as a parameter.\n\nWe also need to pass a dialect as a parameter to this function. There isn't a well-defined standard for comma-separated value files, so the parser needs to be flexible. Flexibility here means that there are many parameters to control how csv parses or writes data. Rather than passing each of these parameters to the reader and writer separately, we group them together conveniently into a dialect object.\n\nDialect classes can be registered by name so that callers of the CSV module don't need to know the parameter settings in advance. We will now register a dialect empDialect.\n\nThe main purpose of this dialect is to remove any leading spaces while parsing the CSV file.\n\n------------\nYou now need to iterate over the CSV file that you opened, i.e., employee_file. When you iterate over a CSV file, each iteration of the loop produces a dictionary from strings (key) to strings (value).\n\nAppend the dictionaries to an empty initialised list employee_list as you iterate over the CSV file.",
